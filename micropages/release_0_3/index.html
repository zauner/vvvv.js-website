  <p class="intro">
    Granted, this version's micropage does not show off visually as much as the <a href="../release_0_2">previous one</a>, but this has not
    been the focus of this version update anyway. Instead, version 0.3.0 comes with improvements under VVVV.js' hood &mdash; improvements 
    in performance, stability and functionality which bring VVVV.js a step closer to becoming a ready-for-production development tool. 
    Here's what's new:
  </p>
  
  <div id="the_patch"></div>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Subpatches</h2>
    The biggest addition in this version is the support for subpatches. If you are into VVVV or similar software, you already know how valuable these are. For those
    who are not familiar with the subpatch concept: you can now group together a patch and form a 'subpatch', which you can nest as a node in
    another patch. You can think of it as functions or classes/modules, if you like. This is great for modularizing your patches, hiding complexity (aka mess) and increasing
    reusability of your code. Read more about subpatches in the <a href="http://vvvv.org/documentation/subpatches">VVVV Documentation</a>.
  </p>
  
  <div class="patch_caption">
    <h4>The Clock Pattern Example</h4>
    If your browser is supported, you should see a pattern consisting of repeating clock designs at the top of this page (inspired by all the gread projects, where
    clocks are mounted next to each other, like <a href="http://florianjenett.de/one-perfect-cube/">here</a> and everything from <a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/?s=clock">here</a>) Click the patch on the right
    to activate the VVVViewer and observe the running patch. It uses subpatches to modularize the five different clock designs, and leaves only switching between
    them to the main page. This is great for various reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Clock designs can easily be added or removed</li>
      <li>
        The main patch does not have to deal with the complexity of the single clock implementations (double click on of the
        subpatches to see what's going on inside)
      </li>
      <li>
        Reusability: there exist two versions, a WebGL and a pure canvas version of this. They only differ in the main patch. The same clock subpatches are
        used in both.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Performance Boost</h2>
    VVVV.js uses underscore.js mainly for iterating through hashes. This is really great because it overcomes Javascript's lack
    of some sort of ordered hashes, and creates more verbous code.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if used at a high frequency (as in every frame) it turns
    out to significantly throttle overall shmoofness. Replacing underscore.js calls with native loops at performance critical code locations brought
    a noticable performance boost and should drastically increase the average frame rate in most cases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h3>Editors</h2>
    VVVV.js now provides an interface for "Editors" &mdash; this can be any kind of program which manipulates the VVVV patches in
    the browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this version, the VVVVJsConnector (which connects classic VVVV and VVVV.js in the browser) has been decoupled from the core,
    and turned into such an "Editor". This paves the way for creating in-browser editors and plug them into VVVV.js effortlessly. In the near future
    there might be a tabular editor which lets you tweak pins during runtime, to begin with. And eventually, this should lead to a full-fledged patch
    editor running inside the browser.
