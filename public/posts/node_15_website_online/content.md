It's only two more months until the amazing NODE15 Festival is taking place in Frankfurt, so yesterday's launch of the [official website](http://node15.vvvv.org) was just in time. As you might have guessed, VVVV.js also has its appearance with a WebGL cloth
animation on the landing page.

The festival program is packed with performances, exhibitions and workshops, which makes it the most exciting week for any VVVV enthusiast.

I will be there and talk about VVVV.js at the [keynode megashow](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/vvvv-keynode-megashow), and also give a [VVVV.js workshop](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/vvvvjs-extending-your-patching-skills-web) together with David Gann.
