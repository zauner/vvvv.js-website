We are back from (an extended) summer break with the official release of version 1.1. If you were at the [Node15 festival](http://node15.vvvv.org) and watched the Keynode Megashow ([video here](https://vimeo.com/129211880)) or joined the workshop, there's nothing new for you here, though. For the rest, I will cover the biggest improvements in a series of blog posts over the next couple of days. In short, here is what's new:

* Built-in code editor for writing your own (inline) nodes
* DOM/CSS/Event Nodes for accessing/manipulating the page VVVV.js is running in
* WebAudio Nodes
* Improved graph evaluation procedure
* JIT-compiling of patches to JavaScript code

For a full list of changes, please view the [CHANGELOG](/vvvv_js/CHANGELOG).

As always, get the latest version from [here](/) or [Github](http://github.com/zauner/vvvv.js), or try it at the [VVVV.js Lab](http://lab.vvvvjs.com)
